# Gauss-Seidel

The Gaussâ€“Seidel method, also known as the Liebmann method or the method of successive displacement, is an iterative method used to solve a system of linear equations. In this program matrix is inputted in an augmented form and then the linear equation is solved if the matrix is diagonally dominant.
