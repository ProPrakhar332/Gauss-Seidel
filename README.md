# Gauss-Seidel

The Gaussâ€“Seidel method, also known as the Liebmann method or the method of successive displacement, is an iterative method used to solve a system of linear equations.
In this program matrix is inputted in an augmented form and then the linear equation is solved if the matrix is diagonally dominant.

Currently it works for 3 variables only and iterates 10 times.

Modifications are being made to make it work for n variables.
